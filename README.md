# -The-Future-of-High-Speed-Low-Power-Computing-A-Review-of-Neuromorphic-Photonics-

## Overview
This work explores neuromorphic photonics, an emerging computing paradigm that combines principles of neuroscience with photonic (light-based) systems. The goal of neuromorphic photonics is to overcome the speed, energy, and scalability limitations of conventional electronic computing by using light for information processing instead of electrical signals.

By mimicking brain-like parallelism and leveraging the ultra-fast nature of photonics, neuromorphic photonic systems show strong potential for next-generation computing, especially in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and high-speed signal processing.
